# Web-application-attempt
This is my first attempt at creating a web application. I decided to use Django to do this since it is Python based. I am new to Django and GitHub so I am learning as I go.
I only uploaded the files I used the most for this project. At first I used CSS to style the html file, but I wasn't satisfied with the look. As a result, I switched to learning and using Bootstrap to see if I could get a better, cleaner look. The main thing that I had a hard time with is the contact form section of this project. I managed to figure out how to handle post and get requests.
In a nutshell, I am having trouble with the overall UI design of this.
